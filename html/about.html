                        <p>
                            In every culture around the world, you can see that seafood is quite common. People have been
                            eating food from the oceans since we could walk, and now we are quickly depleting the world's natural
                            resources. The rate at which we consume some fish now are pushing species to the edge of extinction,
                            which can have devastating effects on both the rich ecosystems as well as the planet as a whole.
                            By studying what we eat, we can make meaningful changes to our lifestyles that are good for both
                            human and ecological health systems.

                        <h2>Why I want to make a change</h2>
                        <p>
                            When the world thinks about climate change and ecological action, the main ideas are often with
                            a green focus in mind. One of the mostly forgotten parts however, is the fact that most of the
                            world's surface is actually covered in water. This also means that most of the world's living
                            creatures actually live in the water, and not on land. Our actions as people should be to protect
                            all of it, not just a couple of species. Our planet is all connected together, and the goal of
                            this website is to highlight a few aspects about how large and grand our world really is.
