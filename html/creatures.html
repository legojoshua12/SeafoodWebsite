                <h3>What are they?</h3>
                <p>
                    Jellyfish are creatures of another time. They have been around since some of the first large creatures
                    on planet earth, swimming in the seas long before anything walked the lands of our Earth.
                </p>
                <h3>What is wrong?</h3>
                <p>
                    In recent times, we have seen a massive boom of jellyfish populations in many places, particularly in
                    places of heavy fishing. This is because when jellyfish are caught as By-catch, fishermen will often
                    cut up the jellyfish before releasing them back into the ocean to die. This results in the babies being
                    released in far larger numbers than what would normally happen.
                </p>
                <h3>What's wrong with this?</h3>
                <p>
                    This boom in population has resulted in the loss of lots of both biodiversity and food sources for many
                    fish. With an unregulated population, it will cause mass extinction of entire food chains, much like a
                    domino effect.

                <h3>What are they?</h3>
                <p>
                    Sharks are ancient predators of the sea, around during the time of the dinosaurs and even earlier. They
                    now make up the bottoms and tops of many ocean food chains, keeping balance to the seas.
                </p>
                <h3>What is wrong?</h3>
                <p>
                    Many sharks have been being killed off for a variety of reasons. In many cultures, people value shark
                    fins for making soups out of, which has caused certain species to be hunted to extinction. Some sharks
                    have been killed out of fear due to movies like Jaws. One of the top killers of sharks though, is By-catch.
                    Many sharks are caught by accident from fishers using trawling. This scoops up as many possible animals,
                    and sharks tend to be unfortunate catches along with fish. By the time the fishermen realise what they have
                    caught, it is too late to save the shark as it it has died from not enough air.
                </p>
                <h3>What Can We do?</h3>
                <p>
                    While there is a lot we can do, the damage to these creatures is severe. It is going to take generations
                    to repair the harm that has been done, and the species that are already extinct cannot come back. We
                    can however, look at what is still around and do our best to try to protect what little environment these
                    ancient predators have left, so that we can protect the food chains they regulate.

                    <h3>What are they?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Another creature of another time, sea turtles have been gracefully gliding around the oceans for
                        millions of years. They feed on a variety of foods and keep the deep seas in check. They also are
                        known for when the go onto land to lay their eggs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is wrong?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The poor sea turtle has taken a heavy hit from coastal cities. The lights and large amounts of people
                        make it hard to new baby sea turtles to find their ways to the oceans and often die on the beaches
                        before they can make it to the safety of the water. Teams have been recruited in many sea turtle
                        egg-laying grounds to help, but these creatures are dying in large rates to By-catch.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What Can We do?</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the best ways to help sea turtles to look at where your seafood comes from. By purchasing from
                        regions of the world that have strict laws on how to handle sea turtles and that require turtle escapes
                        on the trawling nets, you can significantly reduce the impact your food makes on the sea turtle populations.

                <p>
                    Plankton are just about some of the oldest multi-cellular lifeforms on planet earth. In fact, phytoplankton
                    produce most of the world's oxygen, not trees. The life in every ocean at both poles in the world, all natural
                    sources of flowing water, and are extremely durable. They also make up the backbone of every single food
                    chain in the ocean.
                </p>
                <h3>What is wrong?</h3>
                <p>
                    As we continue to burn fossil fuels, we are changing the ph levels of our oceans. Even slight changes
                    can have devastating effects on the plankton in the area. A loss in plankton life can lead to an entire
                    ecosystem collapse if not maintained.

                    <h3>What are they?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Coral is actually not a plant, but an animal! These are some of the most colourful and bright creatures
                        known to the ocean, with some of the most famous places in the world such as the Great Barrier Reef
                        being home to millions of different kinds of corals. These creatures build their magnificent exoskeletons
                        out of calcium and other minerals simply floating through the water.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is wrong?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Coral is dying to a lack of sea minerals that they desperately need. This lack of minerals is being
                        caused by ocean acidification, which takes away compounds such are carbonate and calcium during the
                        breakdown of CO<sub>2</sub>. This cause cause whole reefs to die, killing all the fish and animals
                        that depend on the coral for food, shelter, and protection.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How does coral regrow?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Coral can regrow if we slow the rate at which we depend on fossil fuels. This would allow for oceans
                        to catch up with the atmosphere and for corals to begin to regrow.

                    <h3>Which birds?</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most notable birds being affected is the albatross. These huge birds can travel for weeks
                        without ever landing, constantly flying across the massive pacific ocean. They will catch fish from
                        the surface of the water while flying and eat it without landing.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
                    <p>
                        These birds are top of the line predators, keeping fish population in many parts of the world in check.
                        They are dying a lot of biological buildup of toxins in their bodies. Some of these toxins include
                        plastic, which are consumed from the fish originally. When the fish eats the plastic bits, it can't
                        digest them, so it gets stuck in the fish's body. The bird then eats the fish, so the plastic gets
                        stuck in its body. The bird will continue to eat lots of fish until there is so much plastic that
                        has built up that the bird dies of poisoning its own body.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How does this affect me?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Without these birds regulating many ocean going systems, many of the fish we enjoy to eat will
                        have unstable populations. The food chains will collapse and then we are stuck without food to eat
                        ourselves.
