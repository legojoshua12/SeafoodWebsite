                    <p>
                        One of the main killers of the ecosystem is ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is the process
                        of CO<sub>2</sub> being absorbed out of the atmosphere and into the water. This CO<sub>2</sub> binds
                        with the water molecules to form carbonic acid. In the reaction, leftover hydrogen ions are left to
                        mix with water, lowering the overall PH and increasing the acidity. What doesn't break down as the carbonic
                        acid reacts with the carbonate ions in the water to form bicarbonate ions. This takes away vital
                        nutrients from creatures such as plankton and coral. The increased acidity in the water also harms
                        growth pattern of coral, and has resulted in the loss of billions of creatures and many coral reefs
                        over the past couple of decades. If left untamed, our changes to the climate can potentially lead
                        to the death of all large sealife ecosystems in the world.

                    <h2>Plastic Dumping</h2>
                    <img src="../images/plasticInOcean.jpg">
                    <div class="tinyBar"></div>
                    <p>
                        In the modern day, we use plastic for just about everything we use. Plastic is used to wrap our food,
                        produce the carpets in our homes, insulate our electronics, and the list goes on. While a lot of
                        plastics today can be recycled, it doesn't mean all of them are. Many pieces of garbage are thrown
                        away and escape into our oceans. The rubbish breaks down, but any bits of plastic will survive.
                        These micro pieces of plastic then will float around for potentially thousands of years causing
                        a lot of farm as it floats around the world ocean currents. Fish and birds can easily mistake a
                        small piece of plastic for food, and then consume it resulting in poisoning themselves. Objects
                        such as plastic bottles also serve as perfect vessels for carry microbes across the oceans, resulting
                        in invasive species on new lands. Plastic that a fish eats and then is caught by a fisherman ends
                        up in our own stomachs, and eating plastic is not a particularly appetizing idea.

                    <h2>Overfishing</h2>
                    <img src="../images/ruinedKelpForestScaled.jpg">

                    <p>
                        As the global population has risen over the past century, so has the demand for food. In an effort
                        to try to meet the growing demand, human beings have tried to pull more from the environment, often
                        in unsustainable practices. This has pushed some species such as the Bluefin Tuna to the brink of
                        extinction if we don't change our actions fast. We can get the same foods we like if we monitor
                        the areas we fish and allow time for populations to become stable again. In addition, by not overfishing
                        a particular area, we reduce the risk of disease spread from contaminated food sources.
